Assumptions:

+ either none or only one of buy or sale per day
+ either none or an entry each of split, gain-per-share, and div-per-share
+ if none of the five events exist on a date, then there is no transaction for that date

Fatal errors upon reading an event data file::

+ multiple instances of an event type on the same date
+ both a buy and a sale on the same date
