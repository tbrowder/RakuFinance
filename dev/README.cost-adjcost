What is the "adjusted close?"

Adjusted close is the closing price after adjustments
for all applicable split and dividend distributions.
Data are adjusted using appropriate split and dividend
multipliers, adhering to the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) standards.

Split multipliers are determined by the split ratio

For example:

+ in a 2 for 1 split (2:1) the pre-split data are multiplied
  by 0.5 (1/2)

+ in a 4 for 1 split (4:1) the pre-split data are multiplied
  by 0.5 (1/4)

+ in a 1 for 5 reverse split (1:5) the pre-split data are multiplied
  by 5 (5/1)

Dividend multipliers are calculated based on dividend
as a ratio as a percentage of the price,
primarily to avoid negative hstorical pricing.

For example:

+ If a $0.08 cash dividend is distributed on Feb 19
  (ex. date) and the Feb 18 closing price is $24.96, the
  pre-dividend data are multiplied by (1-0.08/24.96) = 0.9968.

+ If a $2.40 cash dividend is distributed on May 12
  (ex. date) and the May 11 closing price is $16.51, the
  pre-dividend data are multiplied by (1-2.40/16.51) = 0.08546.

+ If a $1.25 cash dividend is distributed on Jan 25
  (ex. date) and the Jan 24 closing price is $52.20, the
  pre-dividend data are multiplied by (1-1.25/52.20) = 0.9756.

Rebuttal:
========

But the historical data are somehow normalized so what
is the magic to unpack it?
