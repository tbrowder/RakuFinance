=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use RakuFinance;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RakuFinance is a module one can use to calculate various data for a portfolio of investments
including basis, gain/loss, current value, and time-series statistics.

The user has to provide the accepted symbols for his or her securities as well as their buy/sell
data in a comma-separated-value file with the appropriate header line (see B<Input Files>)
and historical data available from public data sources.

=head2 Tranactions

Transactions recognized by this module currently are:

=begin table
Type         | Code 
---          + --- 
Buy          | b 
Sale         | sa 
Split        | sp 
Merger       | m  
Dividend     | d  
Capital gain | c  
=end table

Note transaction codes may be entered in lower- or upper-case.

In addition to the transaction type, each transaction for a security
on the same date has a temporal number to distinguish its order
of execution regardless of type.

The following table shows a hypothetical, abbreviated set of transactions
for security XXX (number of shares, prices, and other transacion datate
are not shown).

=begin table
Security | Date       | Trans | Trans
         |            | Code  | Order
---      + ---        + ---   + ---

=end table

=head2 Environment variables

The working directory chosen by the user should be a dedicated directory
with several subdirectories to hold public data of various types. The
user's personal data of buys, holdings, and sales should be
segregated into another directory outside of the working 
directory. The absolute path of that directory should 
be defined in environment variable B<RAKUFINANCE_USER_DATA>.
